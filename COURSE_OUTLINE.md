## Part 1: Understanding Web3 (10 min)

### What's Web3?
- Blockchain + Assets + Protocols
- You already know: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solidity
- **Core idea**: Ownership + Decentralization

### What's a Startup?

**Old way**: Idea → Team → VC → Years → IPO
**New way**: Build fast → Launch → Users → Token → Scale

## Part 2: Web3 Startup = Speed (15 min)

### Why Different?

1. **Token Economics**
   - Users become owners
   - Growth in months, not years

2. **AI Tools**
   - Cursor, Claude
   - Code 10x faster

3. **Community**
   - Users = Marketing
   - Network effects

### Examples
- **DeFi**: Uniswap
- **NFT**: OpenSea
- **Meme**: Pump.fun
- **Infra**: Soul Wallet

- Trade some coins (learn by doing)

### Step 2: Build

- Don't wait for perfect

### Step 3: Hackathon

- 48 hours to ship
- Win prizes = validation

### Step 4: Community
- Talk to people

## Part 4: Real Story (10 min)

### My Journey: 0 to $2.3M in 11 Months

**March 2022**: Quit job
**April**: First hackathon → Prize
**June**: Vitalik tweets ERC-4337
**October**: Soul Wallet launched
**November**: ETH Bogota → $50K
**February 2023**: $2.3M raised

**Lessons**:

## Part 5: Discussion (5 min)

### Your Turn

1. What problem will YOU solve?
2. Can you build something in 1 week?
3. Who are your first users?

**Remember**: Start small, move fast, stay curious.

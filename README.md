# How-to-launch-a-web3-startup
A basic course for our undergraduates in CMU (Chiang Mai University) from Jason Jiao.
In this class, I will use about one hour to ask you some basic questions and discuss, and answer them with your own ideas.

## What's Web3?
You have learned much from Ajarn Kin in this class: Blockchain, Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solidity. In short, a technology about assets and allocation protocols.

## What's a startup?
Commonly, it is like a successful story: you have a good idea and you get a good team, VC is attracted by your cool demo, invests millions of dollars in your project. You are the king of the world in the next 3 years and IPO to NASDAQ.
Idea-->Demo-->Team-->VC-->Scale up-->Market-->PMT-->IPO-->Success

Now, it is changing.
You can learn some basic knowledge about startup from YC: https://www.ycombinator.com/.
Young-->Cutting Edge-->Will&Emotion-->Dropout-->YC&Angel-->Million Users-->Be Rich & Success

## What's a Web3 startup?
Web3 startup is a startup that uses Web3 technology to create new value for users. It is a new type of startup that is different from traditional startups.

### Acceleration
Token & Tokenomics: Cognition-->Tokenomics-->Growth in 3 months-->Done?
High Speed Growth: Ideas-->Dev-->Product-->Market-->Feedback-->Iteration
Powered by AI-->Cursor, Claude and more-->Hackathon-->GoToMarket-->Iteration

### Some Examples
Web3 startup examples include decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

#### Short cuts
Facing Vitalik Coding: like Uniswap, NFT(OpenSea), Polymarket and SoulWallet(my prior project).
Meme Coin: Pump.fun and more
Tooling:
Infra:
My old class material:

## How to begin a Web3 startup?
ï¼Š* Success is an accident, not a plan if you stay curious and never stop playing** .
### Keep Learning and Communication
Yeah, there will be too much knowledge, skills, news, changes overwhelming to you. How to learn and learn what for yourself? It is a choice, not all you need to know.
Communicate with Communities, the guys like you.

### Keep Vibe Coding
Yes, it is GREAT weapon to starters: Got the idea, Got the Product.
And test it in 5 minutes.
AI is not only coding, but a chemical engineer to make it happen in month not a year.
### Keep Trading or Holding Coins
Haha, you must buy some coins and trade, but don't forget to hold some coins for the long term.
You can trade for some gains, but not everyone's a trading genius.
Know when to stop. Take profits and move on.

The real alpha? Building products. That's how you win in this era.


### Join A Hackathon
Based on your experience and knowledge, you can join hackathons to learn more about Web3 technology and build your own project. It is the beginning of your journey in Web3 Startups.

### My story
1. Doing things above
2. Quit on March 29th, 2022.
3. Started communicating with Communities on that night (Know Plancker^_^).
4. Introduced by Plancker^ member to join a Hackathon (team) at the end of April.

7. Our organizor @ Vitalik and got encouragement on launching new products on ERC-4337.
8. Founded the team and developed for 3 months, delivery before October.
9. Joined ETH Bogota Hackathon and got a prize and 50K sponsorship from ETF.
10. Extended team and created milestones, development on SoulWallet.
11. Many VCs wanted to invest in SoulWallet (because of Vitalik).
12. Raised funds from Nov 2022 to Feb 2023, got 20 million valuation and 2.3 million funding.
13. Released products, team building, joined community hackathons and more events.
14. Got PhD Enrollment in June 2023, quit from SoulWallet in September 2023.
15. Many stories about Web3 Startups, it is an awesome journey of learning and growth in your life.

# Words for Young
## Stay Curious, Never Stop Playing
## Connect with the world, not just what's in front of you


## Version 2
After class I got some feedback from Ajarn Kin: give a real practice route for students to follow.
So, I will give 10 minutes to tell the suggestion steps and how-to.

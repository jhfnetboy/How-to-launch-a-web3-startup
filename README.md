# How-to-launch-a-web3-startup
A basic course for our undergraduates in CMU (Chiang Mai University) from Jason Jiao.
In this class, I will use about one hour to ask you some basic questions and discuss, and answer them with your own ideas.

## What's Web3?
You have learned much from Ajarn Kin in this class: Blockchain, Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solidity. In short, a technology about assets and allocation protocols.

## What's a startup?
Commonly, it is like a successful story: you have a good idea and you get a good team, VC is attracted by your cool demo, invests millions of dollars in your project. You are the king of the world in the next 3 years and IPO to NASDAQ.
Idea-->Demo-->Team-->VC-->Scale up-->Market-->PMT-->IPO-->Success

Now, it is changing.
You can learn some basic knowledge about startup from YC: https://www.ycombinator.com/.
Young-->Cutting Edge-->Will&Emotion-->Dropout-->YC&Angel-->Million Users-->Be Rich & Success

## What's a Web3 startup?
Web3 startup is a startup that uses Web3 technology to create new value for users. It is a new type of startup that is different from traditional startups.

### Acceleration
